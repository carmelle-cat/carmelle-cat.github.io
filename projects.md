### Exploring splicing landscapes in single-cells with long-read sequencing
This is a project I concieved as part of a computational single-cell immunology course. Using long-read technology, I wanted to investigate whether or not gene and isoform expression hold the same biological information or if we could elucidate sub cell states and types from the isoform data that are not found in the gene expression data.

### Introduction to Machine Learning Notebook
Co-authored with Prakruthi Burra. We designed this notebook as part of a biannual Python bootcamp that we teach at UC Berkeley.
