I was born and raised in the small island-province of Cebu, Philippines. When I was fifteen years-old I migrated the United States where I lived in the San Fransciso Bay Area. I earned my bachelor's degree in Biomolecular Engineering & Bioinformatics from the University if California Santa Cruz.

When I'm not doing science, I enjoy going on beautiful hikes, running, eating good food with friends, discovering new music, hanging out with my cat or exploring a new artsy hobby!
