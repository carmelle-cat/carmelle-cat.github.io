![Here's a photo of me at the base of Torres del Paine in the Patagonia](/assets/carmelle_patagonia.jpeg)

I was born and raised in the small island-province of Cebu, Philippines. When I was fifteen years-old I migrated the United States where I lived in the San Fransciso Bay Area. I earned my bachelor's degree in Biomolecular Engineering & Bioinformatics from the University if California Santa Cruz. Currently, I'm a PhD student in Computational Biology at the University of California Berkeley.

When I'm not doing science, I enjoy beautiful hikes, swimming, running, eating good food with friends, discovering new music and hanging out with my cat.
