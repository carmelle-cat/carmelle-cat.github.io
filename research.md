#### 1. Bioinformatics for Target Discovery

I have extensive experience building and maintaining bioinformatics pipelines for genomics analyses, with a focus on extracting actionable biological insights from real-world data. My work includes deeply hands-on bioinformatics analysis of complex biological datasets, requiring data wrangling, and custom, ad hoc analytical approaches beyond standardized workflows. I am particularly interested in building pipelines for target discovery problems. My work has involved iteratively refining analysis, integrating multiple data types, and adapting methods to the specific structure and limitations of each dataset.


#### 2. ML for RNA therapeutics
I am also deeply interested in applying machine learning approaches to the design of RNA-based therapies, with an emphasis on post-transcriptional regulation. In particular, I focus on modeling and perturbing RNA splicing and related processes to induce targeted RNA degradation to suppress the expression of deleterious or mutated genes. I aim to develop and apply generative models to enable the design of RNA-targeting therapeutics.

#### 3. Bridging Target Discovery and RNA Therapeutic Design in Single Cell
I am especially excited by opportunities to connect these two areas by integrating large-scale genomics, machine learning–guided therapeutic design, and single-cell technologies. Single-cell approaches offer a powerful framework for studying splicing regulation and RNA processing within heterogeneous cellular populations, particularly in disease contexts such as cancer. I aim to contribute to the development of splicing-based intervention strategies.
